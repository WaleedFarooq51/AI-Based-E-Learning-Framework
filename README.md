# AI-Based E-Learning System for Automated UDP and MCQ Generation

This project is an AI-driven E-Learning assistant that helps educators automate the generation of **Unit Delivery Plans (UDPs)** and **assessment content (MCQs)** based on simple input prompts. It leverages state-of-the-art language models to support lesson planning and evaluation in a structured and interactive manner.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- **General Unit Delivery Plan Generation**
  - Automatically generates a general teaching plan based on inputs like subject, topic, grade level, etc.

- **Day-wise Unit Delivery Plan (DAY UDP)**
  - Breaks down the general plan into daily subtopics with associated learning content.

- **MCQ Generation**
  - Creates multiple-choice questions (MCQs) with options and explanations from daily subtopics.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. **Teacher Input**
   - Inputs include: school name, school type, grade level, subject, main topic, number of days, and corresponding dates.

2. **General UDP Generation**
   - Uses the teacher inputs to generate a structured plan.

3. **Day-wise UDP Generation**
   - Prompts the user for the day and generates associated subtopics.

4. **MCQ Generator**
   - Based on selected subtopics, it generates MCQs with options and explanations.
